How to use this timer:
1. Have timer somewhere else that you need to display. 
2. Add prefab "BasicFillTimer" to scene.
2,5. Set the settings of the prefab, depending on what you want it to do.  
3. Add a reference to "BasicFillTimerController" contained in the prefab you just added. 
4. Send your percentage of completion to the timer. Numbers between 0.0 to 1.0. To get your timers percentage of completion, divide your current timer value by the total timer value. 

You'll make it work i believe.
